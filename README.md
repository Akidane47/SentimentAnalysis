Sentiment Analysis on Articles
This Python project is designed to perform sentiment analysis on articles. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique that determines the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

Overview
The project utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python for text processing and sentiment analysis. NLTK provides various tools and resources for text processing, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis.

Requirements
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You also need to install the following Python libraries:

NLTK
TextBlob
BeautifulSoup (for web scraping articles)

Features
Sentiment Analysis: The project analyzes the sentiment of articles or text inputs and categorizes them as positive, negative, or neutral.
Web Scraping: The project includes functionality to scrape articles from web URLs using the BeautifulSoup library.
Text Processing: It utilizes NLTK for text processing tasks such as tokenization, stop word removal, and part-of-speech tagging.
User Interaction: The project provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with.
Future Improvements
Improved Accuracy: Enhance the sentiment analysis model for better accuracy and reliability.
Multi-Language Support: Add support for analyzing articles and text in multiple languages.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a graphical interface to make it more user-friendly.
Customization Options: Allow users to customize the sentiment analysis process based on their specific requirements.
